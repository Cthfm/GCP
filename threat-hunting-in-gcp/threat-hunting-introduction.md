# Threat Hunting Introduction

## Threat Hunting Introduction

**Overview:**

The following section provides an overview of what threat hunting is and what it is in context to other security disciplines. It also identifies what successful hunting looks like.

**Defining Threat Hunting**

* **Definition**: Threat hunting is the proactive search through networks, endpoints, and datasets to detect and isolate advanced threats that evade existing security solutions. Unlike automated tools, it involves human-driven analysis and intuition to hypothesize about potential undetected threats.
* **Goals of Threat Hunting**: The primary goal is to improve detection and response times to threats before they cause harm, enhancing overall security posture.

**Threat Hunting vs. Other Security Practices**

* **Incident Response**: Incident response is reactive, dealing with breaches after they occur. Threat hunting, conversely, is proactive, seeking to prevent breaches before they manifest.
* **Continuous Monitoring**: While continuous monitoring is about observing systems to react quickly to alerts, threat hunting involves actively seeking out the not-yet-identified threats that exist silently within an environment.
* **Table Comparison**: This section can include a table comparing threat hunting, incident response, and monitoring in terms of objectives, activities, tools used, and outcomes.

**The Role of Threat Hunting in Cybersecurity**

* **Early Detection**: By identifying threats early, organizations can mitigate risks before they escalate into full-blown incidents.
* **Adaptation to Evolving Threats**: Threat hunting allows organizations to adapt their defense mechanisms to the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats, staying one step ahead of attackers.
* **Skill Development**: It cultivates a high level of analytical skills among security professionals, enhancing their ability to think like attackers.

**Examples of Successful Threat Hunting**

* **Case Study 1**: A major retail company used threat hunting to detect a previously unknown type of malware that was siphoning credit card details, preventing millions in potential fraud.
* **Case Study 2**: How threat hunters in a government agency identified subtle signs of an advanced persistent threat (APT), enabling the organization to thwart a potential data breach involving sensitive political data.
