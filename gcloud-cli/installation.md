    sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
    ```

**Step 3: Add the Google Cloud SDK Repository**

    ```

**Step 4: Install the Google Cloud SDK**

    echo 'source "/usr/local/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    (If you're using **zsh**, modify the `.zshrc` file instead of `.bash_profile`).

**Step 3: Initialize gcloud**

    ```

**Alternate Installation Method (Download and Install Manually)**
