# SCC Alerts & Automating Responses

**SCC Alerts & Automating Responses**

In this module, we will explore how **Google Cloud Security Command Center (SCC)** allows organizations to create **real-time alerts** and implement **automated responses**. SCC’s integration with **Pub/Sub**, **Cloud Functions**, and other GCP services enables security teams to quickly respond to incidents and enforce security policies proactively.

***

#### **6.1 Overview of SCC Alerts**

SCC provides powerful **alerting mechanisms** to notify security teams of significant findings. With **alerts**, teams can:

* Respond rapidly to **threats** and **misconfigurations**.
* Track important **security events**.
* Automate **remediation actions** for specific findings.

***

#### **6.2 Types of Alerts in SCC**

SCC alerts can be generated based on **security findings** from:

1. **Event Threat Detection (ETD):** Alerts on suspicious behavior, such as compromised credentials.
2. **Security Health Analytics (SHA):** Detects configuration issues like **public buckets** or **weak IAM roles**.
3. **Custom Detectors:** Trigger alerts on custom conditions, such as changes to firewall rules.

***

#### **6.3 Creating Alerts with Pub/Sub**

SCC integrates with **Google Cloud Pub/Sub** to send **real-time alerts**. Pub/Sub topics allow you to forward alerts to various channels (e.g., Slack, email) or trigger automation workflows.

**Steps to Create a Pub/Sub Alert:**

1. **Create a Pub/Sub Topic:**
   * In the **Cloud Console**, navigate to **Pub/Sub > Topics**.
   * Create a new topic called **scc-alerts**.
2. **Configure SCC to Use Pub/Sub:**
   * Go to **Security Command Center > Settings > Notifications**.
   * Create a new **notification configuration**.
   * Select the **scc-alerts** topic and choose which findings (e.g., critical threats) to trigger alerts.
3. **Set Up Subscribers:**
   * Configure **email, Slack, or PagerDuty** as Pub/Sub subscribers to receive alerts.

***

#### **6.4 Automating Incident Response with Cloud Functions**

With SCC alerts configured, you can use **Cloud Functions** to **automate responses** when critical findings are detected.

**Example: Auto-Remediation for Public Buckets**

**Scenario:** Your team needs to automatically revoke public access from any **Google Cloud Storage bucket** that becomes public.

1. **Create a Pub/Sub Trigger:**
   * In **Cloud Functions**, create a function with the **scc-alerts** Pub/Sub topic as the trigger.
2. **Write the Function Logic:**
   * Use the following Python code to remove public access from any bucket mentioned in the alert.

```python
pythonCopy codefrom google.cloud import storage

def auto_remediate_bucket(event, context):
    finding = event['attributes']
    bucket_name = finding['resource_name'].split('/')[-1]
    
    client = storage.Client()
    bucket = client.get_bucket(bucket_name)

    # Revoke public access
    bucket.acl.all().revoke_read()
    bucket.acl.save()
    
    print(f"Public access removed from bucket: {bucket_name}")
```

3. **Deploy the Function:**
   * Deploy the Cloud Function and link it to the **scc-alerts** topic.

Now, whenever SCC detects a **public bucket**, the **Cloud Function** will automatically revoke public access.

***

#### **6.5 Integrating Alerts with External Tools**

SCC supports integration with popular **SOAR tools** and **SIEM platforms** to extend the capabilities of incident response.

**SCC + Slack Integration:**

* Configure a **Pub/Sub subscriber** to send SCC alerts to a **Slack channel**.
* Use Slack to track incidents and assign follow-up actions to team members.

**SCC + Chronicle or Splunk:**

* Forward SCC findings to **Chronicle** or **Splunk** for deeper analysis and visualization.
* Create dashboards to **track incident trends** and **monitor key metrics** over time.

***

#### **6.6 Creating Custom Alert Rules**

Custom alert rules allow you to trigger alerts based on specific conditions that align with your organization’s security policies.

**Example: Custom Alert for SSH Open to the Internet**

1. **Create a Custom Detector:**
   * In **SCC Settings**, create a custom detector to detect **SSH (port 22) exposure**.
2. **Configure a Notification Rule:**
   * Create a **Pub/Sub alert** for findings generated by the custom detector.
   * Use Cloud Functions to notify the security team or automatically remove the firewall rule.

***

#### **6.7 Hands-On Lab: Creating and Automating SCC Alerts**

In this hands-on lab, participants will:

1. **Create a Pub/Sub Topic** to receive SCC alerts.
2. **Configure SCC to Send Alerts** for public bucket findings.
3. **Write a Cloud Function** to automatically revoke public access.
4. **Integrate Alerts with Slack** using a Pub/Sub subscriber.
5. **Create a Custom Detector** to alert on open SSH ports.

***

#### **6.8 Best Practices for SCC Alerts and Automation**

1. **Use Granular Alert Rules:**
   * Avoid alert fatigue by configuring rules to **prioritize critical findings** only.
2. **Automate Remediation for Common Issues:**
   * Use Cloud Functions to address repetitive issues like **public access removal** automatically.
3. **Integrate with SIEMs and SOAR Tools:**
   * Export SCC findings to **Chronicle** or **Splunk** for deeper analysis.
4. **Regularly Review Alert Configurations:**
   * Ensure alert rules align with **evolving security policies** and **regulatory requirements**.
5. **Monitor Automation Workflows:**
   * Test automation workflows periodically to ensure they function correctly and efficiently.
